CHANGELOG v-0.05

Goal 1) (I spread out the components across many pages rather than 3 for 2 components, because I didn't have much to do on these
pages, because last week I had already done a few components for these pages.) 
  Created 6 new components: 
      - Card components for product page using ng for loop (10 instances)
      - Card components for innovation page without ng for loop (6 instances)
      - Single card component for esports page 
      - Footer for website (
      - Banner for gaming mice page (added routing to mice page)
      - Banner for gaming mouse pads page (added routing to mouse pads page) 
  
Goal 2) My card component created for the product page used an ng for loop to create 10 instances with 6 different attributes
(image, textside, title, description, link, and buttonname)

To-Do: 
  - Currently revamping and fixing navbar
  - Create all the routes for footer
  - Create layout components for all card butttons
  
Bonus features:
  - Created new routes in all components, just need to add layouts for these pages.
  - Routes for mice and mouse pad pages are currently working.
